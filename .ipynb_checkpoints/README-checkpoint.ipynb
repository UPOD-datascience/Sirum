    "Problems:\n",
    "* the population is either assumed perfectly mixed or the parameters are identical over all stratifications -> this will lead to a gross over-estimation of the number of death/critically ill if the mildly affected patients are separated from the weak patients: **SEIRSplus** handles this.\n",
    "* it does not have spatially separated population hubs that interact\n",
    "* it does not have spatially centrally connected points where people interact\n",
    "* increasing the model complexity also increases the number of tunable parameters increasing the risk for overfitting: is there a global optimum for these parameters? Can we come up with a more fundamental model, with less assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions for improvement:\n",
    "* the mild, moderate and clinical patients should be physically separated in 3 models that interact\n",
    "* those 3 models should operate in individual population hubs\n",
