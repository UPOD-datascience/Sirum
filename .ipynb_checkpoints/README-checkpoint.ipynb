In [this](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/6/6/948/4931473) paper analytic expressions are derived for the spatial evolution in so-called random spatial networks.\n",

    "We can also let go of the network, lattice or PDE approach and think of people as moving particles \n",
    "that interact with eachother based on the state they are in. If people are **S**usceptible, they freely move around, if they are **E**xposed they might infect others, and if they are **I**nfected there is a probability that they are immobilized due to the resulting sickness, if they die as a result of the disease they are **R**emoved, and if they are recovered, they are free to move around again but with a much smaller probability of getting infected (we can introduce some resistance factor). \n",
